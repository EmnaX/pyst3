pyst2
=====

Welcome to pyst2's documentation! pyst2 is a powerful python abstraction of the
various `Asterisk <http://www.asterisk.org/>`_ apis. pyst2 makes it easy to
build software using the `Asterisk Gateway Interace (AGI)
<http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+AGI>`_ and `Asterisk Manager
Interface (AMI) <http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+manager+API>`_.

pyst2 can also help debug `Asterisk configuration files
<http://www.voip-info.org/tiki-index.php?page=Asterisk%20config%20extensions.conf>`_
and AGI programs.

Best of all, pyst2 is actively maintained, and has continuously improving code,
tests, and documentation.

.. note::
    pyst2's documentation is currently being written. If you'd like to
    contribute documentation to help speed things up, please `fork the project
    on github <https://github.com/rdegges/pyst2>`_.
